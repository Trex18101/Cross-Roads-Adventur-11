With sharp teeth and powerful jaws unfurled
You roam the jungle with grace and might
Leaving destruction in your wake, a fearsome sight

Your size may be small, but your impact is grand
As you chew through plants with a voracious demand
No tree or bush can stand in your way
For you are the master of the jungle each day

You swim through rivers with ease and delight
A champion of the water, an aquatic knight
And when you emerge from the river's cool embrace
Your fur glistens in the sun, a sight to behold and chase

Oh Capybara, how fearsome and bold you are
A creature of legend, both near and far
You may be a destroyer, but you are also a wonder
A majestic beast, both fierce and full of thunder

So let us bow down to the great Capybara
And marvel at its power, its might and aura
For it is a creature of nature, a force to be reckoned
And its greatness shall never be forgotten.

Verse 1:
In the heart of the jungle, where the trees grow tall,
Lived a boy named Ryan, he was fearless and all.
He roamed through the jungle with a heart full of glee,
And found a new friend, a capybara, so free.

Chorus:
Ryan and the capybaras, the best of friends they were,
They ran and played together, without any care.
Through the rivers and the jungle, they explored it all,
Ryan and the capybaras, they had a ball.

Verse 2:
With his friend by his side, Ryan was never alone,
Together they wandered through the unknown.
The capybara showed him the beauty of the wild,
And Ryan listened, like a curious child.

Ryan and the capybaras, the best of friends they were,
They ran and played together, without any care.

Verse 3:
As they journeyed through the jungle, they learned from each other,
Ryan taught the capybara, about life and the other.
And the capybara showed him how to live in harmony,
With the world around him, so wild and so free.

Though their adventures ended, and they had to part,
Ryan and the capybaras remained in each other's heart.
And the memories they made, in the jungle so grand,
Will always stay with them, like the love of a friend.

Ryan and the capybaras, the best of friends they were,
They ran and played together, without any care.
Through the rivers and the jungle, they explored it all,
Ryan and the capybaras, they had a ball.
